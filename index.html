   Everybody in the world knows about Nelson Mandela. This tribute is not going to reiterate the life and times of Nelson Mandela. This tribute is going to explain why I feel Madiba is such an outstanding person.</p>
<p>
  No one is perfect, and like every single one of us, not even Madiba is perfect, but what he did for his people and how he led the beautiful country of South Africa to freedom is something which always inspires me. Thanks to him, I grew up in a free nation. I am free.</p>
<p>
  Another aspect which I admire is how Madiba valued education. He struggled to become a lawyer, and through all his trials and tribulations he succeeded. His quote <em>"Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world."</em> is one of my most favourite quotes of all time.</p>
